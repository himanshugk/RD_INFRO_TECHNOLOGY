🧠 RD INFRO TECHNO
LOGY — Data Analysis Internship
👨‍💻 Intern: Himanshu Gurjar
🏢 Organization: RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY
🧾 Duration: October–November 2025
💻 Environment: WSL (Ubuntu 24.04) + VS Code + Python (3.12)
🎯 Internship Objective

To design and implement a complete data analysis and forecasting pipeline, from data collection → cleaning → transformation → visualization → AI-powered forecasting, using real retail sales data.

This internship was divided into 3 official tasks and 2 integrated projects that demonstrate full end-to-end data engineering and analytics capability.

🧩 Internship Tasks Overview
Task	Title	Description	Included In Project
Task 1	🧾 Data Collection	Collected retail sales dataset and combined it with real-time exchange rate API data.	✔ Visualization Dashboard
✔ AI Forecasting Dashboard
Task 2	🧹 Data Cleaning	Removed duplicates, handled missing values, fixed datatypes, and ensured dataset integrity.	✔ Visualization Dashboard
✔ AI Forecasting Dashboard
Task 3	🔄 Data Transformation	Generated ML-ready dataset with calculated columns like Revenue, Profit, and Tax.	✔ Visualization Dashboard
✔ AI Forecasting Dashboard
🚀 Integrated Projects
🧩 Project A — Full Project Visualization & Insights Dashboard

Goal:
Create a data visualization dashboard using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to present clear business insights from transformed sales data.

Includes:

Task 1 – Data Collection
Task 2 – Data Cleaning
Task 3 – Data Transformation

Features:

Revenue vs Profit by Product Category

Monthly Revenue Trend

Age vs Revenue Heatmap

Customer Gender Distribution

Output Folder: Task4_FullProjectVisualization/

Sample Outputs:

Visualization	Description
revenue_profit_by_category.png	Category-level business performance

📊 Key Insights

Top Categories: Electronics and Fashion consistently generate the highest revenue.

Customer Demographics: Balanced gender ratio; age 25–35 shows the highest purchase frequency.

Model Accuracy: R² ≈ 1.000 (demo-perfect fit).

Core Drivers: Quantity and Price per Unit most strongly influence total revenue.

🧾 Dataset Source

Retail Sales Dataset (Kaggle):
Retail Sales Dataset – Kaggle

🏁 Outcome

✅ Built a complete Data Analytics & Forecasting System:

Data Collection, Cleaning, and Transformation

Statistical & Visual Analysis

AI-based Forecasting with Model Visualization

This project demonstrates real-world data analyst and AI/ML integration skills, ready for deployment and dashboard extensions (Plotly/Streamlit/Power BI).
